The sidebar also contains options for styling the figure as a whole. Under the "Figure" heading are four sections. The first two, "$x$ Axis" and "$y$ Axis", are identical but affect the $x$ and $y$ axes respectively.
                
    Each of these sections has a field for the axis minimum and maximum. Enter a number to set the minimum or maximum, or leave blank to use the automatic value. Below this is a field for the axis label. See the section below on Maths and Units for information about the available formatting options. There is also a slider for the font size.
                
    Similarly, the "Title" section contains a field for the title of the figure, and a slider for the font size. Leave this empty to have no title.
                
    The "Legend" section contains a toggle to show or hide the legend. If shown, a dropdown for the legend position will be available. The default, "Best", will try to choose the position which obscures the least data. This is usually very good, but the dropdown allows you to manually specify the position instead. Additionally, there is a slider for the font size, and a toggle to use the automatic (theme) colour. If this is disabled, a colour selector will be shown, with which you can set the colour of the legend background, along with a slider to set the opacity.
                
    Below the "Legend" section is a dropdown to select the theme of the figure. This determines the "automatic" colours for all elements, as well as the font colour and background colour.
