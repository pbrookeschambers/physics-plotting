If the sidebar on the left is not already shown, expand it using the small right arrow in the top left. Under "Options", in the "Figure" section, you'll find four expandable sections.

##### Axis Labels

The first two sections contain options for the $x$ and $y$ axes respectively. Expanding the section, you'll see a text field for the axis label in the centre. Use this to set the axis label for the $x$ or $y$ axis. For information on formatting these, see the Maths In Text and Units In Text sections.

Below this text field is a slider for the font size. This can be set separately for the $x$ and $y$ axes, though it is recommended that they are the same.

##### Title

The third expandable section contains options for the title. Expand it to see a text field for the title, which should be used to set the title of the figure. For information on formatting this, see the Maths In Text and Units In Text sections.

Below this text field is a slider for the font size.
