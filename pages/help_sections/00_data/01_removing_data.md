Switch the "Data" panel to the "Current Data" tab. If you have multiple data series, they'll be listed by name in expandable sections (otherwise, there will only be one data series viewable). Expand the series you want to delete. You'll see the data series displayed as a table, and below this a button labelled "🗑️ Delete Series". **This will delete the entire data set,** from both the plot and the stored data. If you only want to delete an individual data point, see the section "Editing Data" below.
