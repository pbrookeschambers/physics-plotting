To start a plot, you'll need to add some data. This is done in the "Data" panel on the right hand side. Switch this panel to the "Add New Data" tab. You'll be presented with three text fields.

##### Name

This is the name of the data set. This app can keep track of and plot many sets of data simultaneously, so each is given a name to distinguish it from the others. This name is only used internally, not on the final plot, so it can be anything you like but **must** be unique. It can be changed at any time.

##### X Data and Y Data

These fields are where you can enter your $x$ and $y$ data. These expect your values as a list, separated by commas (`0.1, 0.3, 0.4`), spaces (`0.1 0.3 0.4`), tabs (`0.1   0.3 0.4`), or newlines:
```
0.1
0.3
0.4
```

These must be entirely numeric. Do not include any units, headers, or other text.

##### Add Data Button

Once you've entered your data, click the "Add Data" button to add it to the plot. You can add as many data sets as you like -- after clicking "Add Data", the data fields will be cleared and a new name will be generated for you.

***Note:** The first time you add data, it may take a while (up to 10 to 20 seconds) to process and generate the plot. Subsequent changes should be faster, but may still take a few seconds with large data sets.*
