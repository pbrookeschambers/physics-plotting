After a set of data has been added, it can be edited or extended. Switch the "Data" panel to the "Current Data" tab. If you have multiple data series, they'll be listed by name in expandable sections (otherwise, there will only be one data series viewable). Expand the series you want to edit. You will see the data displayed as a table. 

###### Changing Data Points

Click on the value you wish to change (you may need to double click on some systems). The value will become editable -- enter any (numeric) value you like, then either press enter or click outside the box to save the change. Any changes will be reflected in the plot.

###### Adding Data Points

You can add rows to the end of your data. It is not possible to add rows in the middle of your data. At the end of your data table (you may need to scroll down), you should see an empty, greyed-out row. Click (or double click) in one of these cells to make it editable. Enter a value, then press enter or click outside the box to save the change. A new row will be added to the end of your data, and the value you entered will be added to the end of the series. Any changes will be reflected in the plot.

***:blue[Note:]** When you add a new row, you will give a value to either the $x$ or $y$ coordinate. The other coordinate will default to $0$ until you edit that value.*

###### Removing Data Points

You can remove rows from your data. To the left of your data is a smaller column which is greyed out. When you hover over a cell in this column, a checkbox will be shown. Use these checkboxes to select whichever rows you wish to remove. Once you select one or more rows, a small set of options will appear above the top right corner of your data table. The first shows a bin icon, and gives a tooltip "Delete Row(s)" when hovered. Click this to delete the selected rows. **Do not click the "üóëÔ∏è Delete Series" button below the data table.** This would delete the entire series, not individual data points.
