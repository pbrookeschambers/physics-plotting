Due to limitations of the toolkit used to create this app, it is very difficult to have persistent storage of your work. Efforts have been made to make this possible, but it is not guaranteed to work, and you should regularly back up your work as described below. Work is identified via browser cookies, so changing computer or browser, or clearing your cookies, will result in your work being lost. Additionally, it will be cleared after 30 days of inactivity.

However, you can save your work to a local file and load it back later. It is recommended that you do this whenever you download your figure, so that you can recover it at a later date.

Make sure that the sidebar is expanded. At the bottom, you will find a section labelled "Advanced". 

###### Downloading Data

To download the data, click on the "Download Data" button. This will download a `.json` file whose name is taken from the filename set for your plot. It contains all of the information to create the figure in the json format. This makes it fairly human-readable, but it is not recommended to edit it manually.

###### Uploading Data

To recover a plot you have downloaded previously, start from a fresh instance of the app (by refreshing the page). At the bottom of the sidebar is a region for uploading a file. Either drag and drop your file into this region, or click the "Browse files" button and navigate to your file. Once uploaded, the file is read and your figure redrawn, and you can continue working on it exactly as you left it.
