If the sidebar on the left is not already shown, expand it using the small right arrow in the top left. Under "Options", in the "Figure" section, you'll find four expandable sections.

Expand the "Legend" section.

###### Showing and Hiding the Legend

The first item in the Legend section is an option to show the legend. To hid the legend, simply disable this option. All other legend properties will be saved, so re-enabling this option will return the legend to its previous state. While disabled, however, all other legend options will not be visible.

###### Legend Position

Below this is a dropdown to select the position of the legend. The default position is "Best", which will attempt to determine the position which obscures the least amount of data. This is usually very good, but you can set the position manually using this dropdown.

###### Legend Font Size

The font size for all legend entries is set by the slider in this section.

###### Legend Colour and Opacity

Below the font size slider is an option to use the automatic colour. If enabled, the colour and opacity of the legend background will be determined by the figure theme (see [Figure Theme](#figure-theme)). If disabled, a swatch of the current colour will be shown (this usually defaults to white). Click it to open a colour selector -- either use the graphical interface to select a colour, or enter the colour code in the box below. Use the arrows to the right to change the colour format between HEX, RGB, and HSL. Once you're happy with your colour, click anywhere else to apply it.

Below this colour selector is an additional slider for the opacity of the legend background. This can be set between $0.0$ (completely transparent) and $1.0$ (fully opaque), with the default being $1.0$. Note that this does not affect the opacity of the text or line/marker previews in the legend.
