Once you've added some data, you can determine how it will be displayed. Note that these options apply to individual data series if you have more than one set of data. If the sidebar on the left is not already shown, expand it using the small right arrow in the top left. Under "Options" in the "Data" section, you will see a dropdown to select the data series you want to edit. If you only have one set of data, this dropdown will not be shown.

##### Shape

Expand the "Data Series" section. Under the "Marker" heading, you'll find a dropdown to select the shape of the marker. There are many options, including "None" for no marker. If you just want a line plot, select "None" -- you'll note that the further options for the markers are no longer shown.

For a scatter plot, set the marker shape to any option (except "None"), and the line style to "None" (see the Line Styles section below).

##### Colour

Beneath this dropdown is the option to use an automatic colour. If enabled, the colour will be determined based on the figure theme (see the Theme section). If disabled, a swatch of the current marker colour will be shown (this usually defaults to black). Click it to open a colour selector -- either use the graphical interface to select a colour, or enter the colour code in the box below. Use the arrows to the right to change the colour format between HEX, RGB, and HSL. Once you're happy with your colour, click anywhere else to apply it.

##### Size

Below this is a slider for the size of the markers. Use this to change the size of the markers, between $0.0$ and $20.0$. The default is $10$.
