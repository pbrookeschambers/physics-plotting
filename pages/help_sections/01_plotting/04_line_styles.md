Once you've added some data, you can determine how it will be displayed. Note that these options apply to individual data series if you have more than one set of data. If the sidebar on the left is not already shown, expand it using the small right arrow in the top left. Under "Options" in the "Data" section, you will see a dropdown to select the data series you want to edit. If you only have one set of data, this dropdown will not be shown.

###### Style

Expand the "Data Series" section. Under the "Line" heading, you'll find a dropdown to select the style of the line. There are several options, including "None" for no line. If you just want a scatter plot, select "None" -- you'll note that the further options for the line are no longer shown.

For a line plot, set the line style to any option (except "None"), and the marker shape to "None" (see the [Markers and Scatter Plots](#markers-and-scatter-plots) section above).

###### Colour

Beneath this dropdown is the option to use an automatic colour. If enabled, the colour will be determined based on the figure theme (see the [Figure Theme](#figure-theme) section). If disabled, a swatch of the current line colour will be shown (this usually defaults to black). Click it to open a colour selector -- either use the graphical interface to select a colour, or enter the colour code in the box below. Use the arrows to the right to change the colour format between HEX, RGB, and HSL. Once you're happy with your colour, click anywhere else to apply it.

###### Width

Below this is a slider for the width of the line. Use this to change the width of the line, between $1.0$ and $5.0$. The default is $1.0$.
