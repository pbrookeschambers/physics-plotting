Once you've added some data, you can determine if and how it will be displayed in the legend. Note that these options apply to individual data series if you have more than one set of data. If the sidebar on the left is not already shown, expand it using the small right arrow in the top left. Under "Options" in the "Data" section, you will see a dropdown to select the data series you want to edit. If you only have one set of data, this dropdown will not be shown.

###### Show in legend

Expand the "Data Series" section. Under the "Legend" heading, you'll find an option to show the data series in the legend. If you have more than one data series, you can use this to hide some of them from the legend. It is enabled by default.

###### Legend label

If the data series is shown in the legend, you can change its label here. By default, this will start as the name of the data series, but these do not have to be the same. For example, you may want to change the label to something more descriptive, or to include units. Use the text field to set the legend label. For tips on formatting this, see the sections [Maths In Text](#maths-in-text) and [Units In Text](#units-in-text).

###### Legend Formatting

The font size, colour, and position of the legend are set globally. See the section [Legend Options](#legend-options) for more information.
