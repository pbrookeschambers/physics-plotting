Whenever you refresh the page, all of your work will be cleared. This is unfortunately unavoidable with the framework used to build this app. However, you can save your work to a file and load it back later. This may be a good idea to do generally as good practice, in case you want to make changes to your figures later.

Make sure that the sidebar is expanded. At the bottom, you will find a section labelled "Advanced". 

##### Downloading Data

To download the data, click on the "Download Data" button. This will download a `.json` file whose name is taken from the filename set for your plot. It contains all of the information to create the figure in the json format. This makes it fairly human-readable, but it is not recommended to edit it manually.

##### Uploading Data

To recover a plot you have downloaded previously, start from a fresh instance of the app (by refreshing the page). At the bottom of the sidebar is a region for uploading a file. Either drag and drop your file into this region, or click the "Browse files" button and navigate to your file. Once uploaded, the file is read and your figure redrawn, and you can continue working on it exactly as you left it.
