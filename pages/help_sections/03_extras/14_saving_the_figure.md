If the sidebar on the left is not already shown, expand it using the small right arrow in the top left. At the bottom of the sidebar are the options for saving the figure. First, there is a dropdown to select the file type. The available options are:
- PDF
- PNG
- SVG
- PS
- EPS
            
Below this is a text field for the filename. This will be the name as you download the figure. Do not include the file extension in this field (i.e, enter `plot`, not `plot.png`). Once you are happy with your figure, enter a filename and click the "Download" button. This will download the figure to your computer.
