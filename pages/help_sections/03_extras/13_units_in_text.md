Any text which is rendered in the final plot can include units. This is done with a special syntax: `unit{...}`. Within the curly braces, type the unit names separated by spaces. Use standard prefixes, like `kilo`, `micro`, and `giga`, and use `squared` or `cubed` as needed. Use `per` to indicate division. For example, an acceleration might be written as `unit{centi meter per second squared}`, which would be rendered as $\text{cm}\,\text{s}^{-2}$. Combining these, you might have a $y$-axis label which reads `Acceleration, $a$ (unit{meter per second squared})`, which would be rendered as "Acceleration, $a$ ($\text{m}\,\text{s}^{-2}$)".
