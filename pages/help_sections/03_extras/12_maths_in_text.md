Any text which is rendered in the final plot can include maths. This is done using something called $\LaTeX$ syntax. Maths should be enclosed in dollar signs. For example, `$\frac{m}{M+m}$` would appear as $\dfrac{m}{M+m}$ on the plot. Your $y$-axis label might be, for example:
```latex
Relative Error, $\epsilon = \left|\frac{g_{calc} - g_{actual}{g_{actual}}\right|$ (dimensionless)
```
which would appear as the following in the figure:

Relative Error, $\epsilon = \left| \dfrac{g_{calc} - g_{actual}}{g_{actual}}\right|$ (dimensionless)

For an explanation of the syntax and common symbols, see the [LaTeX Cheat Sheet](/LaTeX_Cheat_Sheet) page.
