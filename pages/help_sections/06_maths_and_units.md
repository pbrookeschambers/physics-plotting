All of the text rendered in the figure can include maths. This is done using $\LaTeX$ syntax, which encloses maths in dollar signs (like `$\alpha$` $\rightarrow$ $\alpha$). You can find a cheat sheet for the basics of this syntax on the "LaTeX Cheat Sheet" page. This allows you to include things like fractions, greek letters, and functions in axis labels. For example, `Mass Fraction, $\frac{m}{M+m}$` would be rendered as "Mass Fraction, $\frac{m}{M+m}$".

Units can also be included by using `unit{...}`. Within the curly braces, type the unit names separated by spaces. Use standard prefixes, like `kilo`, `micro`, and `giga`, and use `squared` or `cubed` as needed. Use `per` to indicate division. For example, an acceleration might be written as `unit{centi meter per second squared}`, which would be rendered as $\text{cm}\,\text{s}^{-2}$. Combining these, you might have a $y$-axis label which reads `Acceleration, $a$ (unit{meter per second squared})`, which would be rendered as "Acceleration, $a$ ($\text{m}\,\text{s}^{-2}$)".
